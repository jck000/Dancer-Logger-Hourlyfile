=head1 NAME

Dancer::Logger::Hourlyfile - Rotate writing to log files on an horly basis


=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class will write log entries to a separate file every hour.  It will append YYYMMDDHH to hour logfile name.  If you have multiple servers in a distributed environment, you can even specify to use GMT for the time.  Finally, you can specify even greater breakdown by writing into subdirectories YYYY/MM/DD/

  filename:

      log/2007120119_filename.log
      ^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^
      |   YYYYMMDDHH Filename 
      Path

              
  extended:

      log/2007/12/01/2007120119_filename.log
      |              ^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^
      Path           YYYYMMDDHH Filename 


=head1 CONFIGURATION SETTINGS

In your Dancer's environment file set the following:

  logger:     "hourlyfile"   # tell Dancer to use this module
  log_path:   "/var/log"     # full path
  log_hourly: "filename"     # defaults to "filename" if not specified.
                             # The only other option is "extended"
  log_file:   "outputfile"   # file name
  log_time:   "local"        # defaults to "local" if not specified.  
                               The only other option is "gmt" 


=head1 SAMPLE CONFIGURATION

=over 4

=head2 filename(default)


    logger:     "hourlyfile"
    log:        "core"
    log_path:   "/var/mydancerapp/logs"
    log_file:   "myserver"
    log_time:   "gmt"
    log_hourly: "filename"

  This configuration will produce the following files where the times are GMT:

    /var/mydancerapp/logs/2014052000_myserver.log
    /var/mydancerapp/logs/2014052001_myserver.log
    ...
    ...
    ...
    /var/mydancerapp/logs/2014052023_myserver.log


=head2 Extended 


    logger:     "hourlyfile"
    log:        "core"
    log_path:   "/var/mydancerapp/logs"
    log_file:   "myserver"
    log_time:   "gmt"
    log_hourly: "extended"

  This configuration will produce the following files where the times are GMT:

    /var/mydancerapp/logs/2014/05/20/2014052000_myserver.log
    /var/mydancerapp/logs/2014/05/20/2014052001_myserver.log
    ...
    ...
    ...
    /var/mydancerapp/logs/2014/05/20/2014052023_myserver.log
